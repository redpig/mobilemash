# MobileMash - ESP32 Phone Button Presser

A 3D-printable, ESP32-controlled servo harness for programmatically pressing
phone buttons. Primary use case: booting phones into fastboot mode unattended.

## Supported Phones

| Phone | Status |
|-------|--------|
| Pixel 10 Pro | v1 |

## How It Works

Two SG90 micro servos are mounted in a 3D-printed cradle that clips around the
phone. Each servo has a small arm that presses a button (power, volume-down).
An ESP32 dev board drives the servos and accepts commands over USB serial.

### Fastboot Sequence

1. **Force shutdown** - Press and hold power for up to 30 seconds (or until
   told to release).
2. **Enter fastboot** - Hold volume-down, then briefly press power. Release
   when told or after a safety timeout.

## Wiring

```
ESP32 GPIO 13 --> Power servo signal (orange)
ESP32 GPIO 14 --> Volume-down servo signal (orange)
ESP32 5V      --> Both servo VCC (red)
ESP32 GND     --> Both servo GND (brown)
```

## Firmware

Built with PlatformIO (Arduino framework).

```bash
cd firmware
pio run -t upload
```

### Serial Protocol (115200 baud)

Commands are newline-terminated ASCII:

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `PRESS_POWER <ms>` | Press power button for `<ms>` milliseconds |
| `PRESS_VOLDN <ms>` | Press volume-down for `<ms>` milliseconds |
| `FASTBOOT [shutdown_ms] [combo_ms]` | Run full fastboot entry sequence |
| `RELEASE_ALL` | Immediately release all buttons |
| `STATUS` | Report current state |
| `PING` | Returns `PONG` |

Responses are newline-terminated:

| Response | Meaning |
|----------|---------|
| `OK <detail>` | Command accepted / completed |
| `ERR <detail>` | Error |
| `STATE <json>` | Status response |
| `PONG` | Ping reply |

## 3D Printing

OpenSCAD source in `cad/`. Export STL and print with:
- Material: PLA or PETG
- Layer height: 0.2mm
- Infill: 20%+
- Supports: not required

## Host Tool
